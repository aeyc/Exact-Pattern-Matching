NOTE: text.fa, pattern.fa and notInText.fa are sample inputs that I used, which is provided under the assignment. User can modify them or delete and add new inputs.

NOTE: I used sample screenshots in my report(Tascioglu_Ayca_hw1_Report.pdf) to demonstrate how I worked the program on terminal. If you have any problem with process, please take a look.

To run the code:

1) Please go to the directory of where source code(hw1.py) located.
 
2) Add the text file and pattern file that you want to use, in the same file with the source code.

3) After, in the terminal go to the directory where hw1.py and desired input files( i.e text.fa and pattern.fa) are located.

4) type 'make'.

5) The program will run and asks for the names of the files you want to use as input. 

	Type the name of text file (should be located in same file with program code):
	
	>>**type your text file name here**

	Type the name of pattern file (should be located in same file with program code):

	>>**type your pattern file name here**

6) It will run the algorithms in a menu in a while loop until the user types '0'.

	Welcome to exact string matching comperator bot!
	If the pattern is in text, locations will be printed in 1-based coordinate
